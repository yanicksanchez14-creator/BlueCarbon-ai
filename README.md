# BlueCarbon-AI

**Mapping the coastal ecosystems that store carbon (mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass meadows) from
satellite imagery with machine learning, and estimating how much carbon they hold.**

## The problem

Coastal wetlands ("blue carbon" ecosystems) capture carbon up to several times faster per hectare than
land forests and keep it locked in their soils for centuries. They are also disappearing, and
conservation groups, governments and carbon-credit projects need to know **where they are, how large
they are, and how much carbon is at stake**. Mapping them by hand from imagery is slow and doesn't
scale.

## What BlueCarbon-AI does

1. **Pulls free satellite imagery.** It builds a cloud-free Sentinel-2 composite for any coastline and
   season through Google Earth Engine.
2. **Maps habitats automatically.** A trained model labels every 10 × 10 m pixel as open water,
   mangrove, salt marsh, seagrass, tidal flat or other land.
3. **Estimates carbon with honest uncertainty.** Habitat areas are corrected for the model's known
   error rates, then converted to stored carbon and yearly uptake using IPCC reference values, reported
   as a likely range rather than a single number.
4. **Serves it in a web app.** Anyone can explore mapped sites, switch between satellite, false-color and
   habitat views, and read a plain-language summary of the results.

## Highlights

- **End-to-end geospatial ML pipeline.** Earth Engine ingestion, Cloud Score+ cloud masking, seasonal
  median composites, and tiled download of any area size in the correct map projection. One CLI and one
  YAML config drive every stage.
- **Trained on published scientific maps.** Reference labels are fused from ESA WorldCover, the Murray
  et al. global tidal-flat maps and the Allen Coral Atlas across **11 coastal sites on four continents**.
- **Evaluation designed not to cheat.** Training tiles never overlap, whole 5 km blocks go to one data
  split, and entire estuaries are held out, so scores reflect performance on coastlines the model has
  never seen.
- **Two model families, the best one wins.** A gradient-boosted (LightGBM) spectral model with
  water-column features, and a U-Net deep neural network (ResNet-34 encoder). The pipeline trains both
  and keeps whichever maps blue carbon habitats more accurately.
- **Carbon accounting with uncertainty.** Areas are bias-corrected (Olofsson et al., 2014), and carbon is
  estimated with 5,000-draw Monte Carlo sampling over IPCC Tier 1 coefficient ranges.
- **Production engineering.** Installable Python package, typed configuration, self-describing model
  files, an automated test suite that runs the full pipeline offline, and GitHub Actions CI.

## How it works

```
Sentinel-2 imagery ──► cloud masking + seasonal composite ──► 10 bands + 9 spectral indices
                                                                        │

                                                                        ▼
                                             LightGBM spectral model  /  U-Net  (best one kept)
                                                                        │
                                   habitat map ──► error-corrected areas ──► carbon stored & absorbed per year

**Python** · PyTorch · segmentation-models-pytorch · LightGBM · Google Earth Engine API · Rasterio / GDAL ·
NumPy / SciPy · Streamlit · Folium / Leaflet · Pydantic · Typer · pytest · GitHub Actions

## Run it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yanicksanchez14-creator/bluecarbon-ai.git && cd bluecarbon-ai
pip install -e ".[gee,app,dev]"

streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py      # the web app, using the bundled demo sites
pytest -q                               # offline end-to-end tests
```

The full pipeline (download, label, train, map) runs with `bluecarbon fetch`, `chips`, `train` and `scene`.
It needs a Google Earth Engine project, and there's a ready-made GPU notebook in
[`notebooks/train_colab.ipynb`](notebooks/train_colab.ipynb).

## Limitations

Carbon figures use IPCC global averages per habitat and are suited to screening and prioritizing sites,
not to issuing carbon credits, which requires field measurements. Seagrass is the hardest habitat to see
from space because it grows underwater, and tides change what is visible in intertidal areas.
